overview
================

provide search functions to system


use cases
================

Dominic remembers seeing a document about fraudulent accounting
practices some months ago, but cannot seem to find it. He
enters "fraudulent accounting" in the search box. The system
returns a list of matching documents

features
================

search through generic content

non-features
================

stuff other than 'content' will not be indexed


implementation notes
================

cron job will run to do indexing


Lingua::Stem::EN
Lingua::EN::Tagger
	will take text, find words+phrases, do stemming,
	return wordlist + counts

================

for non-content objects:

create a table, containing names of tables, columns, oidcolumn to index
any object can ($x-init.sql) then add itself to be searched


would it be easier to just hardcode the indexer code?

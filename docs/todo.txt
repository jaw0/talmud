something like the palm pilot ToDo application:

able to create many lists
each list:
    contains items
    can be public|private
    can have comments

each item:
    can have a priority level
    can have due date
    can have comments
    has flag: finished

should it tie in with tkts, events, ... ?


perhaps, each list is a list of objects
or a list of tasks, and tkts subclass tasks

    task { public_p, finished_p, priority, due_date, owner? }

    owner = user, group, tkt_section,

================================================================
a task is a list of tasks
================================================================

ticket:
    task.refers_to = tkt_section

================================================================

view tasks:
    top level tasks: refers_to is null or not a task => not isa_task(refers_to)
    sub level tasks: refers_to = $oid

================================================================

need:
    view-task
    add-task
    edit-task
    list-tasks
================================================================

trigger:
    prohibit clearing active_p if exists active sub-tasks

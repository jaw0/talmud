user belongs to a set of groups

component specifies a set of required groups
	the user must belong to at least one

component specifies type of access that component performs:
	read, write, create, delete
	(maybe also: audit, )
	default => read

object specifies mapping of groups => permitted access
as an acl, of the form:

	privlist; grouplist = privlist; ...

	first privlist pertains to the owner
	empty grouplist, or group of * pertains to public
	grouplist: space separated list of groups
	privlist:  smooshed together list of single letters

	eg:
		rwc; group1 group2 = rc; group3 = rwc; r

	also permit just privlist to indicate public (no grouplist, no =)


default if no acl is set => 'rwc; rwc'

acl is only relevant and checked on directly accessible objects
